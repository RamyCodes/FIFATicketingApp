                    The Last Minute Sales Phase is open. <br/><br/><br/>
                    The online Last Minute Sales Phase is currently open and will run until the end of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ on 18 December.
                    We advise football fans to purchase their desired tickets (subject to availability) as soon as the sales phase opens, as tickets 
                    will likely sell out quickly.<br/><br/><br/>
                    During this sales period, tickets will be allocated on a first come, first served basis, and ticket purchases are processed as a real-time transaction, 
                    subject to availability. All successfully purchased tickets will be confirmed immediately to the ticket applicants.<br/><br/><br/>
                    From 18 October 2022, customers already in Qatar can visit the FIFA Main Ticketing Centre (MTC) located at the Doha 
                    Exhibition and Convention Center (DECC), and from 30 October 2022 the Ticketing Centre (TCX) located in Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiyah 
                    Arena (ABHA Arena in Al Sadd) for ticket purchases, customer service enquiries and mobile ticket supports.<br/><br/><br/>
